The Met has since become the preeminent cultural institution in the Western Hemisphere, serving a public that extends far beyond New York City to all the United States and the world.

Since its inception, the Orchestra has championed the new music of its time, giving the first performances of many important works. This pioneering tradition has continued to the present day, with works of major contemporary composers regularly scheduled each season. A longtime media pioneer, the Philharmonic has a long history of broadcasting on radio and television. More recently, the Philharmonic became the first major American orchestra to offer downloadable concerts, recorded live, and released by DG Concerts exclusively on iTunes.",

    "mission": "The New Criterion, a monthly review of the arts and intellectual life, was founded in 1982 by the art critic Hilton Kramer and the pianist and music critic Samuel Lipman. Now edited by the critic Roger Kimball, The New Criterion began as an experiment in critical audacity—a publication devoted to engaging, in Matthew Arnold's famous phrase, with “the best that has been thought and said.” This also meant engaging with those forces dedicated to traducing genuine cultural and intellectual achievement, whether through obfuscation, politicization, or a commitment to nihilistic absurdity. We are proud that The New Criterion has been in the forefront both of championing what is best and most humanely vital in our cultural inheritance and in exposing what is mendacious, corrosive, and spurious. Published monthly from September through June, The New Criterion brings together a wide range of young and established critics whose common aim is to bring you the most incisive criticism being written today.",

The Foundation then turned its attention to the restoration of Ellis Island--the largest historical restoration in the history of the United States. Ellis Island, our most potent symbol of the American immigrant experience, had become sadly deteriorated. When the Island opened in 1990 it unveiled the world-class Ellis Island Immigration Museum, where many rooms appeared as they had during the height of immigrant processing.",

As Resident Theater Company of 59E59 Theaters, Primary Stages produces a season of 3-5 plays each year. We develop new works through commissions, workshops, and readings and supports playwrights through our two flagship programs - The Dorothy Strelsin New American Writers Group and the Marvin and Anne Einhorn School of Performing Arts (ESPA). Since our founding in 1984, we have produced more than 100 new works, many of them world premieres, and engaged more than 2,000 theater artists.

    "mission": "In the words of New York Times' critic Ben Brantley, Mint Theater is the “resurrectionist extraordinaire of forgotten plays.” We scour the dramaturgical dustbin for worthwhile plays from the past that have been lost or neglected—and we create new life for them through production, publication, and educational initiatives. The Mint was founded in 1992. Jonathan Bank became artistic director in 1995 and began to shape the company's mission, focusing on lost plays. Our first major success came in 1999 with the American premiere of THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE, written by Harley Granville-Barker in 1905. “A playwright, and a company, couldn't do much better,” wrote the New York Times. Our work has been recognized with an Obie Grant (2001), a special Drama Desk Award (2002), and the Theater History Museum's Theatre Preservation Award (2010) along with a host of Drama Desk and Lucille Lortel Award nominations. In fulfilling our mission, we've created some the most compelling theater in New York. As Gwen Orel wrote in the Irish Examiner “We are lucky in New York to have the Mint here. If all they did was find and stage these plays, it would be enough, but what they do is reincarnate them into striking works of art.”",

Soon a more formal mission was born: to present distinctive work that raises the standards of Off-Off-Broadway for artists & audiences alike.

Now celebrating its 100th anniversary season, The National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene has a burgeoning creative engine, but must maintain a connection to future generations who may never have heard of Yiddish or encountered Eastern European Jewish culture in its original form. While this material has evolved in America to suit contemporary sensibilities in the form of the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld or Woody Allen, the music of Matisyahu, or nearly any musical play in the American canon, its source material is largely neglected and those seeking cultural roots are often stymied by the language barrier of Yiddish. The NYTF provides access to the treasure trove of hundreds of years of cultural expression, and with this project is seeking to inspire the imaginations of the next generation of artists to continue and contribute their own stories to this valuable work.",

Walter Rosen was the master planner for the Caramoor estate, bringing his dream of creating a place to entertain friends from around the world to reality. Their musical evenings were the seeds of the International Music Festival of today. With its outstanding performances, engaging arts-in-education programming, the extraordinary Rosen House, and beautiful grounds, Caramoor is a cornerstone of the cultural life of Westchester County and beyond. Since 1945 visitors have delighted in the exceptional music - from classical to opera to jazz - and the enchanting garden setting that makes Caramoor such a unique and treasured resource.",

Five hundred acres of landscaped lawns, fields and woodlands provide the site for postwar sculptures by internationally renowned artists. The focus of Storm King Art Center's distinguished permanent collection of American and European modern sculpture is on large abstract welded steel works from the 1960s to the present, although figurative works are also on view. At Storm King, visitors are encouraged to enjoy nature as well as art, to meander on trails and discover sculptures, or to traverse the fields to walk among monumental works. Recently the Art Center has developed the North Trail and a wooded grove with sculptures, and has restored several walking paths.",

Founded in 1932, PRI has outstanding programs in research, collections, publications, and public education. The Institution cares for a collection of nearly three million specimens (one of the 10 largest in the U.S.). PRI is a national leader in the development of informal (i.e., outside the classroom) Earth science education resources for educators and the general public. PRI's Museum of the Earth was established in 2003 to provide the public an opportunity to explore our world through a mix of natural history displays, interactive science features, and art exhibitions. In 2013, the Cayuga Nature Center became PRI's newest public venue for education. The Nature Center cultivates an appreciation and responsibility for the natural world through outdoor and environmental education and the goal is to create a premier educational center for teaching and learning about the impact of climate change. PRI is separate from, but formally affiliated with Cornell University, and interact closely with numerous University departments in research, teaching, and public outreach.",

Performing with many of today's most dynamic and esteemed soloists, Orpheus presents an annual concert series at Carnegie Hall that illuminates both classic orchestral repertoire and new works by contemporary composers. Noted by critics and audiences alike for their unsurpassed energy, sensitivity, and connection to listeners, Orpheus is considered one of New York's cultural treasures. Orpheus is a self governing organization. Central to its distinctive personality is its practice of sharing and rotating leadership roles. For every work, the members of the orchestra select the concertmaster and the principal players for each section.",
